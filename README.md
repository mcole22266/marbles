# The Marble Race

## About

This is a website created primarily as a hobby project. The motivation was a Marble Racing _sensation_ created
by Tanner Sheets during the covid-19 crisis. The site allows visitors to see the current standings in any 
Series Cup as an Admin can update race data in numerous ways.

## How To Run

1. Create a `secrets.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

    - GMAIL_USERNAME - used to send emails to site goers
    - GMAIL_PASSWORD - used to authenticate email

2. Be sure to have docker-compose installed on your machine.
3. In the terminal, build and launch the app with `docker-compose up --build`
4. When the build is complete, navigate to `localhost`.
