                            White Lightning has had an uphill battle to get back here in the limelight, he was once a young phenom who was cocky beyond belief.

                            He walked and talked like he owned the world and nothing could stop him.
                            
                            A Rough patch hit him and he hit rock bottom, with all of his bridges burned… he had no one. No one except Parker Sheets, his on field reporter from day one.
                            
                            He trained harder than ever and is now back on top to prove he belongs.
